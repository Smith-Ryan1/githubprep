# Week 1 â€“ Introduction to Security Awareness
 
**Description:**  
This week covered why Security Awareness is so important in not just Cybersecurity but also our daily lives. We also identified different types of attackers such as Hacktivists, who infiltrate systems in the name of protest, and Script Kiddies, who use basic, premade hacks to cause damage to systems.

**Reflection:**  
This week was entirely about what Cybersecurity is and who we defend our security from. This knowledge, while barebones, is entirely helpful in laying out why we do, what we do. Furthermore, in the reading we learned how to set up defences, in the manner of a castle under siege. By adding multiple layers to protect, analyzing what did and did not work, how to reduce losses, and ultimately making sure all of the defences are up to snuff, we can protect against stronger and stronger attacks.
