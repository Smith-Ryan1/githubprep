My Ethical Lens: 
I am a personal fan of Rene Descartes and am a fan of his rationalism approach to ethics. That being said, I take a kinship to his approach to thinking about the situation as if it were a challenge to be hurdled when approached, “what is the best way I can get through this, in the most efficient way, while still being effective.” Similarly, I agree with the notion of Descartes ethics being applied to technology. I want the most bare bones, this is how this is, this is how this should be, how can we get from this to that, method as I possibly can. I am a numbers person, two plus two must equal four, what about this code is not how it should be, how can I get it to that point. 

Authorization Principle: 
An authorization principle is the agreed upon set of rules for someone given clearance to access a network, with potential negative consequences for breaching the rules. A campus example for this would be the university guest wifi, before you connect you must agree that you will not use their free public wifi for anything other than what they say it is for, with disconnection as a possible negative consequence.

Authorization Policy: 
An authorization policy is an agreement between two parties outlining how a service should be used. This is the case in most public wifi networks. 

Policy Snippet: 
Use of this Network indicates an agreement to the fair use policy and confirms that you are an authorized user. Use of this Network is restricted to those provided to authorized users with their specified clearance level and shall not be used in any other manner. All data shall be secured and any breach of this policy should be immediately reported to the acting head of technology. Violations to any and all agreements will result in immediate termination.

Reflection: 
I would like to refine my idea of what a AUP is, mainly I want to look at some other, better, examples than the public wifi AUP here at Hocking. Furthermore, I would like to re-read some of the more confusing ethical frameworks and see if there is anything that would better suit me or if my statement is correct.
