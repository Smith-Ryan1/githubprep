What I learned: 
After examining the frameworks provided to me, I believe I will be leaning more towards the ACM code of ethics as it is both well worded and has a focus on human access and privacy. This is more in line with my personal view of ethics, more so than ICS2, and yet more thoroughly defined than IEEE. Looking at the textbook “protecting personal privacy and data” (CITE THIS LATER) should come first in every situation, however, ICS2 doesn’t quite state that. Reading through the IEEE, it reads as a summary for ACM and doesn’t include human care as its first goal. 
	
How will I apply it: 
I can see using the ACM framework of ethics everyday, communicating with people, as well as in the office working with computers and navigating the legal and ethical questions that may arise. In my current job, people come first always, I strive to make sure that the people that I work for want me to work for them, that is good business. If a private Cyber Security company does not take complete care of their contractors they will not have a company. In the office, I can foresee myself using this framework in a, for lack of a better term, “what would ACM do” sort of way. I believe that, in each circumstance, I will use my better judgement in a high-stress situation, but I can also use the ACM code of ethics if I cannot make a judgement. 
	
Muddiest Point: 
I would say my most muddy point, or at least my biggest question, is how human ethicists and their ideas translate to AI. Would they adopt our ideals through human input in their learning algorithms or would they adopt their own set of ideals given enough time and development?
